I am a third-year Computer Science PhD candidate at the <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science">University of Virginia</a> advised by <a href="http://yangfengji.net/">Dr. Yangfeng Ji</a> in the <a href="https://uvanlp.org/">Information and Language Processing (ILP) Lab</a>. My research interests lie in natural language generation and evaluation, as well as data quality analysis and data selection strategies.

Prior to starting my PhD at UVA, I completed my undergraduate coursework at St. Maryâ€™s College of Maryland, where I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a double major in Computer Science and Psychology.

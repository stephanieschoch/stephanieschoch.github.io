I am a third-year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Virginia (UVa) advised by Dr. Yangfeng Ji in the Information and Language Processing (ILP) Lab. My research interests lie in natural language generation and evaluation, as well as data quality analysis and data selection strategies for transfer learning.

Prior to starting my PhD at UVa, I completed my undergraduate coursework at St. Maryâ€™s College of Maryland, where I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a double major in Computer Science and Psychology.
